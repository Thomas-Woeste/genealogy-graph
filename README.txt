Assignment: Geneology.cpp
Purpose: The purpose of this assignment is to create a family tree program that can keep track of the shortest path between two people added. 

Contents:
genealogy.cpp: This is the main file of this assignment. It handles all the input of data and handling of sorting and printing the family trees. 
README.txt: The current file that has the documentation data on the assignment.
data.txt: This is a provided file with set inputs to test the family tree.
Makefile: This is used to compile the program together, as well as zip a final output.

Executing the Program:
To run this program download the provided files above. Then type make into the command terminal to compile the program together. Make will automatically
pass into STDin the data.txt file above.

Austin Arnold and Chance Bennett were used to initially discuss methods of handling input into arrays the families and people.

Caleb Lytle and Bradley Hargis were used to initally discuss the methods to handle the verify and BFS searches.
